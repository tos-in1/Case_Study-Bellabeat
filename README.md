# Bellabeat Wellness

## Project Summary
Bellabeat, a small successful high-tech wellness company focused on women’s health wants to break into and become a global player in the smart device market.

## ⭕ The Problem?
Bellabeat has limited insight into the broader patterns of how consumers interact with fitness devices. Without a deeper understanding of users' habits, Bellabeat’s marketing strategies may not effectively resonate with potential customers, thus hindering opportunities for market growth and product adoption.

## 🎯  The Objective
To analyze data from a smart fitness tracker (Fitbit), uncover trends and patterns in user daily activity.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL (Google BigQuery)
- Tableau Public
- PowerPoint

## 🔍 Key Trends Discovered
1. Many users remain sedentary for more than half the day
2. Users burn more calories with increased steps taken
3. Most users are more active on Mondays, Tuesdays and Saturdays

## 💡 Strategic Marketing  Recommendations
1. Introduce “Move More” reminders and short, guided activities on the Bellabeat app
2. Focus marketing  campaigns around "step goals" and "calorie burn challenges"
3. Schedule weekly campaigns, tips, or flash deals to drop on Mondays, Tuesdays and Saturdays
