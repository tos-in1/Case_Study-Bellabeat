# 🌿 Bellabeat: Smart Device Usage Analysis

## Business Summary
Bellabeat is a wellness-oriented tech company that manufactures smart health products tailored for women. While already being a successful small brand, Bellabeat aspires to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Its product suite includes the Bellabeat Leaf, Spring, and Time—designed to help users monitor daily activity, sleep, stress, and overall well-being.

## ⭕ Business Problem?
As Bellabeat looks to expand beyond its current success and compete in the global smart device market, one critical challenge stands in the way — a lack of broad consumer insight into how individuals use smart fitness devices. Without a clear understanding of user behaviors and habits, the company’s marketing strategies risk falling short in attracting new users, increasing product adoption, and positioning its offerings effectively in a highly competitive landscape.

## 🎯  Project Objective
As a data analyst, I was tasked with analyzing public smart device usage data (FitBit) to uncover patterns in users’ daily activiting. These insights will inform Bellabeat’s marketing team to align their strategies with actual user behavior and better position their products for broader adoption.

## 💡 Strategic Marketing  Recommendations
**2. **HOW** could these activity trends help influence Bellabeat’s marketing strategy?**
- Since a higher percentage of users exhibit a sedentary behaviour, Bellabeat should integrating real-time inactivity alerts and encouraging movement through subtle prompts or short guided activities. This would help users stay active and reduce sedentary habits.
  
- Bellabeat can launch community-based challenges that focus on daily or weekly step goals and calorie targets can drive user participation and brand loyalty. These challenges should be positioned as fun, rewarding, and backed by its wellness mission—offering badges, rewards, or discounts for completing milestones to keep users engaged.

- Usage trends indicate that user activity tends to rise on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Saturdays. So Bellabeat can capitalize on this by scheduling key marketing initiatives—such as email campaigns, wellness tips, flash sales, or product announcements on these high-engagement days. This timing strategy increases the likelihood of user interaction and campaign visibility.
